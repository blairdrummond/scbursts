# SCBursts - Single Channel Bursts Analysis

This `R` Package was originally designed for use by the [daCosta lab](http://www.dacosta.net/), but is being provided to the wider Single Ion-Channel analysis community (or whoever else might find use in the package). 

**The package contains the following features:**

- Transform data between formats generated by TAC, QUB, Clampfit, SCAN, etc.
- Correct for effects of the Gaussian filter on the time-series data.
- Identify bursts in time series, and isolate those bursts.
- Provide toolkit for sorting, filtering, and studying individual bursts.

If any features seem wrongfully absent, or if any methods can be improved upon, feel free to either create an [issue](https://github.com/dacostalab/scbursts/issues) or (even better) submit a pull request.

# Installation

## From a tarball (easy)

Get the `scbursts_*.*.tar.gz` file from [releases](https://github.com/dacostalab/scbursts/releases). You should then be able to install from this file within R-Commander, R-Studio, or from the command-line with

~~~
R CMD INSTALL scbursts_*.*.tar.gz
~~~

## From CRAN (easier)

Once the package gets uploaded to CRAN, in `R` you can run

```
install.packages("scbursts")
```

and then, as usual, just run

```
library(scbursts)
```

to get started.

## From `R` (with pdf documentation)

If you have `LaTeX` and `pandoc` installed, you can install the package **and** generate some documentation for it (this is optional. If you don't have those see the next section). 

Open an R console, and run the following lines

```{.R}
install.packages("devtools",  repos="http://cran.rstudio.com")
install.packages("knitr",     repos="http://cran.rstudio.com")
install.packages("rmarkdown", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com")
install.packages("roxygen2",  repos="http://cran.rstudio.com")
install.packages("readxl",    repos="http://cran.rstudio.com")
install.packages("tibble",    repos="http://cran.rstudio.com")
install.packages("tinytex",   repos="http://cran.rstudio.com")
library(devtools)
install_github("dacostalab/scbursts", build_vignettes = TRUE)

# to update install run
# install_github("dacostalab/scbursts", build_vignettes = TRUE, force=TRUE)
```

You should then be able to call

```{.R}
library(scbursts)
```

and to see documentation run

```{.R}
vignette("scbursts")
```

## From `R`

If you have `LaTeX` and `pandoc` installed, you can install the package **and** generate some documentation for it (this is optional. If you don't have those see the next section). 

Open an R console, and run the following lines

```{.R}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("dacostalab/scbursts", build_vignettes = TRUE)

# to update install run
# install_github("dacostalab/scbursts", force=TRUE)
```

You should then be able to call

```{.R}
library(scbursts)
```

## From Source 

**You only want to do this if you plan to modify the package. Otherwise use another option**

1. Start by installing the dependencies. On Ubuntu

```
# apt-get install texlive-full pandoc pandoc-citeproc make r-base pkg-config libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev
```

With those installed, you can install this from source with `make`. You will need to make sure that you have this installed. Once you have it, the steps are:

2. Get a copy of this repository, either by downloading a zip or by `git clone`-ing.

3. Open a terminal in the directory

4. You will also need some `R` packages. If you have write access to your R library path, then you can run `make deps`. Otherwise in an `R` terminal run

```{.R}
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("roxygen2")
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("tibble")
install.packages("tinytex")
```

5. Now, back in the shell, you can run `make` (or `make export`) and `make install`.

And then the package should be installed. Note that you won't be able to create any manuals unless you have LaTeX and pandoc installed.

# Manual

You can view the soft-documentation for this package by calling

```{.R}
vignette("scbursts")
```

from an R console.
